## COMPLEX NETWORKS - ARTIST NETWORK FROM SPOTIFY 
The project focuses on the analysis of complex networks. 
In this case, the network is based on data obtained from the Spotify application. 
I am analyzing a network of artists connected by albums on which they appear together. 
The project aims to study complex graphs, their properties, and the analysis of real-world data, as well as drawing insights from it.
